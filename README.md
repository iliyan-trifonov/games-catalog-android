Games Catalog for Android
===

This Android application was made to be a companion for a site selling PS3 games.

It downloads the latest advertisements, gives you an option to sort the results, shows you the ads'
authors, price, published date.

It uses colors and icons for better UI where you can check quickly what's new and what's changed.

You can search through the ads, add them to the favorites, check the ad's full info, view its
original image, send email or make a phone call to ask the seller about it.
You can also get all of the ads for a particular seller.

I've removed the real url which was used to fetch the data in JSON format and I am leaving the source
code here for reference. I've also converted the project to a Gradle build one.

This app was created a couple of years ago and is my first and only app for Android/Java. I've made a
beta version of this having multiple categories in tabs but didn't finished it.
Looking at the code today I see there are many optimisations that can be made.
Still what was done was good for my level then and I hope I will have a motivation and a new idea
to realize again with Java for Android.

Enjoy! :-)
